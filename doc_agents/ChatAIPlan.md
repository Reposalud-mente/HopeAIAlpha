Detailed Plan for AI Chat Enhancement
1. Enhance System Prompt and Knowledge Base
Files to modify:
src/app/api/consultas-ai/route.ts
src/prompts/clinical_assistant_prompt.md
I'll create a more comprehensive system prompt that:
Incorporates evidence-based clinical guidelines
Includes detailed instructions for analyzing patient data against diagnostic criteria
Provides guidance on generating well-founded explanations with scientific references
Ensures privacy and ethical considerations are maintained
2. Integrate Patient Data Access
Files to modify:
src/app/api/consultas-ai/route.ts
src/app/consultas-ai/ConsultasAIChat.tsx
I'll add functionality to:
Allow the AI to access patient data when requested (with proper authentication)
Create a secure method to retrieve patient clinical history
Implement a mechanism to analyze patient data against diagnostic criteria
Ensure all data access is logged and secured
3. Implement Diagnostic Criteria Integration
Files to modify:
src/app/api/consultas-ai/route.ts
Create new file: src/lib/ai-chat/diagnostic-criteria-service.ts
I'll develop a service that:
Provides the AI with access to DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria
Allows comparison of patient symptoms against diagnostic criteria
Generates evidence-based explanations for diagnostic matches or gaps
Maintains references to scientific sources
4. Enhance Chat UI for Clinical Decision Support
Files to modify:
src/app/consultas-ai/ConsultasAIChat.tsx
src/components/ai/ai-chat.tsx
I'll improve the UI to:
Add a patient context panel for viewing relevant patient data
Create specialized visualization components for diagnostic analyses
Implement a citation system for scientific references
Add tools for saving insights to patient records
5. Implement Longitudinal Analysis Capabilities
Files to modify:
src/app/api/consultas-ai/route.ts
Create new file: src/lib/ai-chat/longitudinal-analysis-service.ts
I'll develop functionality to:
Track and analyze patient progress over time
Visualize clinical evolution with charts and timelines
Provide predictive insights based on treatment response patterns
Generate comparative analyses against expected outcomes
6. Enhance Memory and Context Management
Files to modify:
src/app/api/consultas-ai/route.ts
src/app/consultas-ai/ConsultasAIChat.tsx
I'll improve how the chat maintains context by:
Implementing a more sophisticated conversation memory system
Creating a mechanism to reference previous insights and recommendations
Developing a system to track which patient data has been analyzed
Ensuring context is maintained across sessions
7. Implement Privacy and Security Enhancements
Files to modify:
src/app/api/consultas-ai/route.ts
Create new file: src/lib/ai-chat/privacy-filter.ts
I'll strengthen privacy protections by:
Implementing a PII detection and filtering system
Creating audit logs for all data access
Ensuring compliance with healthcare privacy standards
Adding explicit consent mechanisms for patient data analysis
