# HopeAI Development Best Practices for Alpha Phase

## Introduction

This document outlines the development best practices, code principles, and quality standards for the HopeAI Alpha phase. Following these guidelines will help ensure a successful Alpha test with the five psychologists, maximize the value of the $300 GCP credit, and deliver a stable, high-quality platform.

The HopeAI platform is built using Next.js with App Router, leveraging Next.js API routes for serverless backend functionality rather than a traditional RESTful API architecture. This approach aligns with our Cloud Run deployment strategy and enables efficient development of our integrated telehealth platform.

## Core Development Philosophies

### 1. Pareto Principle Focus (20/80 Rule)

The 20% of the codebase that generates 80% of the value for Alpha testers includes:

- **Patient Management**: Core CRUD operations and data model
- **Clinical Documentation**: Note-taking and report generation
- **AI-Assisted Features**: RAG implementation and floating assistant
- **Telehealth**: Google Meet integration
- **Authentication & Security**: User management and data protection

Prioritize stability, performance, and user experience in these areas above all else.

### 2. Alpha-First Mindset

- **Scope Discipline**: Strictly adhere to the defined Alpha scope in the Strategic Plan
- **Feedback Orientation**: Design for easy collection of tester feedback
- **Cost Consciousness**: Optimize for GCP free tier usage and minimal credit consumption
- **Iterative Approach**: Build for rapid iteration based on tester feedback

### 3. Cloud-Native Development

- **GCP-Optimized**: Design with GCP services in mind (Cloud Run, Vertex AI, PostgreSQL)
- **Serverless-First**: Prefer serverless architectures to minimize infrastructure management
- **Managed Services**: Leverage managed services to reduce operational overhead
