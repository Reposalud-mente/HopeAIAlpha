# Prisma Models

This project uses Prisma as its ORM. The database schema, including all models, relations, and enums, is defined in [src/prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:src/prisma/schema.prisma).

Refer to this file to understand the data structure and relationships within the application's database.

## Key Models:

The schema defines several core models that are central to the application's functionality:

*   `User`: Manages user accounts, including clinicians and potentially other roles.
*   `Clinic`: Represents clinic information.
*   `Patient`: Stores patient data and their relationships with users (clinicians).
*   `Assessment`: Details about patient assessments, linking to patients, clinicians, and clinics. Includes various sub-components like `ConsultationReason`, `EvaluationArea`, `DSM5Criteria`, and `ICDCriteria`.
*   `Appointment`: Manages appointment scheduling for patients and users.
*   `Message`: Likely for communication between users and patients.
*   `Session`: Represents clinical sessions, linking to patients and clinicians.
*   `Report`: For generating and storing reports based on assessments.
*   `ClinicalNote`: Allows clinicians to record notes related to assessments.
*   `AuditLog`: Tracks actions performed within the system.

## Enums:

The schema utilizes several enums to manage predefined sets of values, such as:

*   `Role`: Defines user roles (e.g., `ADMIN`, `CLINICIAN`).
*   `AssessmentStatus`: Tracks the status of assessments (e.g., `DRAFT`, `COMPLETED`).
*   `AppointmentStatus`: Manages the status of appointments (e.g., `SCHEDULED`, `CANCELLED`).
*   `SessionStatus`: Indicates the current state of a session (e.g., `DRAFT`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`).
*   `AuditAction`: Specifies the type of action recorded in the audit log.

Understanding these core models and enums is crucial for working with the application's data layer. The `schema.prisma` file provides the complete definition for these and other supporting models and their relationships.
